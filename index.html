      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Mediation in criminal cases is a form of restorative justice where victims and offenders engage in structured dialogue. It aims to address harm, promote accountability, and reach mutual understanding outside of traditional court settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Benefits of Mediation in Criminal Justice</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Victim Empowerment</h3>
        <p>Victims have a chance to express how they were affected, ask questions, and receive direct acknowledgment of the harm done.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Offender Accountability</h3>
        <p>Offenders are encouraged to take personal responsibility and make amends, which can reduce the likelihood of reoffending.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Community Healing</h3>
        <p>Mediation promotes healing and restoration, helping rebuild trust within communities affected by crime.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section id="process">
      <h2>How the Mediation Process Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Referral from a judge, lawyer, or community program.</li>
        <li>Voluntary agreement from both parties to participate.</li>
        <li>Pre-mediation meetings to prepare each party.</li>
        <li>A structured, confidential dialogue session led by a trained mediator.</li>
        <li>Creation of an agreement or understanding, if possible.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="challenges">
      <h2>Limitations & Challenges</h2>
      <p>While promising, criminal mediation is not suitable for all cases. Challenges include power imbalances, emotional trauma, and public perception. Mediation must be voluntary, safe, and handled with sensitivity to avoid re-traumatization.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Mediation offers a human-centered alternative to traditional criminal justice processes. By fostering accountability and dialogue, it supports healing for victims, growth for offenders, and stronger communities.</p>
